            <p>I specialize in applications written in React, PHP, and Python. Recently I became also a huge fan of one-way data flow and Redux-like architecture and also typed languages, e.g. TypeScript. My current experience and skills in front-end include: lead TypeScript/JavaScript development: bootstrapping or refactoring an existing app architecture, by improving itsâ€™ extensibility and reliability; full integration of front-end development using tools like Webpack with features like automatic code reload, code minifications, multiple environments support, good sense of design and UX, by having some small past experience in graphic design knowledge and huge experience in many JS ecosystem, by using many libraries like React, Redux, Redux-Observable, RxJS, Angular, Ionic Framework, Backbone, jQuery, Lodash/Underscore and whatever else was needed. 11single page applications done completely in Angular or React7talks given about front-end development</p>
